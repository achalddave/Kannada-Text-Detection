Reducing the complexity of the Kannada characterset

    They do an analysis of Kannada and show some structural information that
    can be used for recognition. Very useful, with one caveat: they are doing
    online handwritten character recognition, which means they have a
    separation of strokes purely by time. We need to separate strokes in space.
