% Five criteria are considered:
%
% [1] The number of pixels in a connected component: If this number is less
% than SIZE_THRESH, then the connected component is reassigned to a value
% of (-1) and considered GUARANTEED NOT TEXT. This constitutes coarse
% filtering and the result of this operation alone is returned in
% coarse_filt.
%
% [2] The height and aspect ratio of a connected component: If the height
% is less than 10 pixels or larger than 300 pixels, or if the aspect ratio
% is larger than 10 or less than 0.1, then the connected component is
% reassigned to a value of (-2) and considered GUARANTEED NOT TEXT.
%
% [3] The variance of stroke widths: If this number is greater than
% GNT_VAR_THRESH, then the componenet is reassigned to a value of (-3)
% and considered GUARANTEED NOT TEXT.
