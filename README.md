# EE225B (Digital Image Processing) Final Project

Detecting Kannada in natural scene images

## Goal

This is a modified version of the [Stroke Width Transform][1]. Currently, the
modifications should improve detections on any language, but our goal is to
improve the accuracy with which Kannada text is detected and to decrease the
false positive rate, even at the cost of detecting other languages.

## Implmented modifications

1) Erosion (morphological)

    Morphological erosion is used for two improvements: removal of small
    non-axis aligned line-like components, and stroke width variance
    thresholding.

    The original SWT thresholds components using a few metrics, primarily ones
    involving their height, width, and stroke width variance. Unfortunately,
    this results in a number of diagonal lines and small patches. Eroding the
    component and thresholding by the number of pixels fixes this issue.

    Second, in natural images, letters are often not perfectly segmented by
    most edge detectors (especially for signs in developing countries that are
    often carved in stone), which results in components containing small
    erroneous pixels outside of letters. The regular stroke width variance
    thresholding ignores these due to the extra pixels; to avoid this, we use an
    erosion to only look at the variance of the core of the image.

2) Multi step thresholding
    This is more of an implementation detail, but it's extremely helpful for
    performance to threshold in more than one step. We found that the default
    SWT provided millions of extremely small components (1-2 pixels).
    Unfortunately, the various thresholding methods in this algorithm are
    difficult to vectorize, meaning it is necessary to loop over every
    component. However, we can vectorize the removal of very small components
    using typical MATLAB (or any other languages') functions, reducing the
    components to thousands before doing further checks.
